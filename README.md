Hi there, I’m @Cyberpunk-2027
I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence, mobile device security (Android), and transhumanism.
I’m currently learning about cybersecurity, IT support, AI, coding, OSINT
I’m open to collaborating on all things cybersecurity, AI, Blockchain technology, coding (Python in particular), and OSINT journalism.
Feel free to message me on here, and I will try to respond as soon as possible.
Fun fact: I'm a black belt in Karate.
Favorite motto: You can only see as far as you think.
