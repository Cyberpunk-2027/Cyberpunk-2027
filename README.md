Greetings, I’m @Cyberpunk-2027.
Primary interests would include Artificial Intelligence, mobile device security (Android), transhumanism, and IT support.

Currently learning about cybersecurity, IT support, AI, coding, OSINT journalism, among a few other various subjects. I’m open to collaborating on all things cybersecurity, AI, Blockchain technology, coding (Python in particular), all things Android, and OSINT journalism.

Fun fact: I'm a black belt in Karate.

Favorite motto: You can only see as far as you think.

I am currently for hire, preferably in one of the areas mentioned above.
